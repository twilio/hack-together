## Hack Together
![Hack Together logo](images/hacktogether.png)
Goal: to connect, support, educate, entertain, and empower the hacker community during a trying time when many have been displaced from their campuses.

Submit a PR with a question you'd like to ask the Father of Python Guido van Rossum then tune in 3/28 at 4pm to see if it's answered on [Twilio TV](https://twitch.tv/twilio). We'll have other activities, talks, games, and [contests](#asynchronous-contests) throughout the weekend of [LA Hacks](https://lahacks.com/), [RowdyHacks](https://www.rowdyhacks.io/), and [HooHacks](https://www.hoohacks.io/) to keep you entertained and learning.
