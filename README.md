## Hack Togetherr
![Hack Together logo](images/hacktogether.png)
** schedule is done for the day after the keynote Q&A due to streaming setup difficulties and we apologize for any confusion <3 
Goal: to connect, support, educate, entertain, and empower the hacker community when many have been displaced from their campuses with a series of [Twilio TV livestreams](https://twitch.tv/twilio) with games, contests, talks, workshops, and more throughout the day, interspersed with breaks and [contests](#asynchronous-contests) like 
- <em>draw-the-owl</em>: draw and owl and show us on Slack or in Twitch chat!
- [TwilioQuest](twilio.com/quest), a video game and training tool to earn XP, swag, and an IRL  Zelda sword (we will mail it to college hackers)                                                 
- #DevWithSign. post to social media picture of yourself AT HOME with a homemade sign similar to [Dude with Sign](https://www.forbes.com/sites/heatherleighton/2020/01/28/meet-the-creators-of-the-dude-with-sign-instagram-account/#460ad5b01d7d) with the hashtags #HackTogether and whatever hackathon you are attending (LA Hacks, HooHacks, or RowdyHacks).

(more info at the bottom under [asynchronous contests](#asynchronous-contests))

Submit a PR with a question you'd like to ask the Father of Python Guido van Rossum then tune in 3/28 at 4pm to see if it's answered on [Twilio TV](https://twitch.tv/twilio). We'll have other activities, talks, games, and [contests](#asynchronous-contests) throughout the weekend of [LA Hacks](https://lahacks.com/), [RowdyHacks](https://www.rowdyhacks.io/), and [HooHacks](https://www.hoohacks.io/) to keep you entertained and learning.
